# PROJECT: Calendar App

### Overview

It's high time to get organised with upcoming events and tasks at hand. Inspired by our busy lives and seemingly neverending list of tasks, our team has come together to develop a simple application to solve this problem. The goal of this project is to create a simple calendar application that can handle basic functionalities outlined below using a TDD (Test Driven Development) approach. Test Driven Development is a software development practice that focusses on creating unit test cases before development (Unadkat, 2021). This leads to a more robust and well-documented code that can be improved and refactored with the unit testing in mind.

### Aim

The aim of this project is to collaborate with other developers on a self-asigned project and apply skills and knowledged we have accumulated over the past 12 weeks.
